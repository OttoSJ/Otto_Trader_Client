# Otto Trader App

NOTE: Otto Trader is not real website[^1]

### Why Otto Trader?

Otto Trader was built with the intention of furthering my knowledge and understanding of how to use and interact with technologies such as React, Axios, Fetch, React-Dom, and Redux to name a few.

### What is Otto Trader?

Otto Trader is an app that connects people who are intending to sell the vehicles to potential buyers. Otto Trader allows users to browse the vehicles on the site and once they find a vehicle they are interested in they can then contact the seller and make arrangements to inspect and or but said vehicle. Users also have the option to create an account if they would like to save a vehicle to a fovorites list. Sellers must register with the site in order to post their vehilces. Once a user is registered, they can then register a vehilce with the site which includes providing details of the vehilce and an image. The seller has control over what vehilces in their inventory they want to post to the main page at any given time.

### How to run Otto Trader on your local machine.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
